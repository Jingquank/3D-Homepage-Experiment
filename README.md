# 3D Homepage Experiment

A 3D carousel of character models with a connecting line to the details panel.

## Preview

**Live preview (GitHub Pages):**  
https://jingquank.github.io/3D-Homepage-Experiment/

(Or open `react-app.html` directly: https://jingquank.github.io/3D-Homepage-Experiment/react-app.html)

### Enable GitHub Pages (if not already on)

1. Open the repo on GitHub → **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, choose **Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch: **main**, folder: **/ (root)** → Save
4. After a minute or two, the preview link above will work.

## Run locally

Open `react-app.html` in a browser (use a local server if loading 3D models fails over `file://`):

```bash
npx serve .
# or: python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:8000).
